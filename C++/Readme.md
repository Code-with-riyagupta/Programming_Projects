# C++ Basic Programs

Welcome to my C++ Programming Repository!  
This repository contains a collection of real life projects based on C++ programs that demonstrate important programming concepts such as:

- Variables and Data Types  
- Loops (for, while, do-while)  
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)  
- Functions (with and without parameters)  
- Recursion  
- Arrays and Pointers  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects).

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.  
2. Open the `.cpp` files in your favorite C++ compiler.  
3. Compile and run the code.

## 📂 File Structure

- `hello.cpp` — A simple Hello World program  
- `loops.cpp` — Programs related to loops  
- More files will be added as I progress...

##  About Me

I am currently learning C++ and Data Structures.  
This repository is a part of my learning journey and will be updated regularly with new concepts and programs.
